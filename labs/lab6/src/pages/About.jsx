        <p>Hi, I'm Manuga Yuthmin Wijesundara Bandara, a third-year Computer Science student at Dalhousie University with a passion for AI and networks. I'm particularly interested in exploring how intelligent systems can optimize network performance and solve real-world challenges. Beyond academics, I love working out and have recently taken up running as a new challenge. I'm always excited to learn, build, and collaborate on innovative tech projects!</p>
